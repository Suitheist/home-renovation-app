## Project Context

### Problem Statement
Homeowners undertaking renovation projects face a **crisis of confidence and support** that leads many to abandon projects, make costly mistakes, or experience deep discouragement. This crisis manifests across four interconnected dimensions:

**1. Financial Anxiety & Information Gaps**
Homeowners struggle with high-stakes financial decisions without reliable data. They cannot validate whether contractor quotes are reasonable (e.g., "Is Â£70,000 for 30 windows fair for my area?"), lack baseline budgets for projects, and face complex decisions about whether to start with partial funding or risk inflation by waiting.

**2. Technical Knowledge Barriers**
DIYers face constant uncertainty about how to execute tasks correctly. They cannot diagnose problems from symptoms (cracks, leaks, water damage), lack step-by-step guidance for specific procedures, and make expensive material selection mistakes.

**3. Planning & Scoping Paralysis**
Novice renovators don't know where to start. They cannot visualize spatial layouts to fit desired features within constraints, lack realistic timeline estimates for projects, and struggle to sequence tasks properly.

**4. Emotional Toll & Discouragement**
The most poignant challenge: homeowners express devastating frustrationâ€”*"Everything I do just makes my house look cheaper/worse. I am so discouraged I don't want to work on it anymore."*

### Product Vision
Build an AI-powered home renovation planning app that bridges the gap between consumer and professional tools while addressing the core emotional, financial, and technical challenges that cause homeowners to abandon or regret their renovation projects.

### Target Users
1. **Primary**: DIY homeowners managing their own renovation projects
2. **Secondary**: Homeowners working with contractors who need collaboration tools
3. **Future**: Small contractors or landlords / owners of multiple properties

### Success Metrics (MVP)
- User acquisition: 100 users in first 3 months post-launch (July 2026)
- Engagement: 60% weekly active users
- Retention: 40% retention after 30 days
- Revenue: Â£2,000 MRR by month 6

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
**Frontend:**
- Framework: React (web) / React Native (mobile)
- UI Design: Visily or Banani for mockups
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- State Management: React Context + hooks initially, consider Redux if complexity grows

**Backend & Data:**
- Database: Airtable (MVP prototype) â†’ migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- Authentication: Auth0 or Supabase Auth
- API: RESTful initially, consider GraphQL for complex queries
- File Storage: AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2

**AI Integration:**
- AI Chatbot: OpenAI GPT-4 API for renovation advice
- Budget Forecasting: Custom ML model or GPT-4 with structured outputs
- Receipt/Invoice Parsing: OpenAI Vision API

**Development Tools:**
- IDE: Cursor (primary AI coding assistant)
- Version Control: GitHub
- Hosting: Vercel (web) or AWS Amplify
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### Architectural Principles
1. **Mobile-first design**: Optimize for on-the-go usage at hardware stores and job sites
2. **Offline-first**: Core features must work without internet (sync when connected)
3. **API-first**: Design backend to support future integrations and third-party access
4. **Progressive enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
5. **AI-augmented, not AI-dependent**: AI features should enhance UX, not be required

### Data Model (Core Entities)
**Projects**
- id, name, address, start_date, target_end_date, status, total_budget, user_id
- Relations: has many Tasks, Expenses, Documents, Photos

**Tasks**
- id, project_id, name, description, status, assigned_to, due_date, dependencies, estimated_cost, actual_cost
- Relations: belongs to Project, has many Subtasks

**Expenses**
- id, project_id, task_id, category, amount, date, vendor, receipt_image_url, payment_method, notes
- Relations: belongs to Project and Task

**Documents**
- id, project_id, name, type, file_url, uploaded_date, tags
- Relations: belongs to Project

**Photos**
- id, project_id, task_id, file_url, caption, taken_date, tags, location
- Relations: belongs to Project, optionally linked to Task

## Design Principles

### User Experience
1. **Clarity over features**: Simple, focused interface beats feature bloat
2. **Quick capture**: Add expenses, photos, notes in < 10 seconds
3. **Visual progress**: Always show budget vs. actual and task completion
4. **Contextual AI**: AI suggestions appear when helpful, not intrusive
5. **Trust through transparency**: Show AI reasoning for budget forecasts

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Type safety**: Use TypeScript throughout
2. **Component modularity**: Max 200 lines per component
3. **Reusability**: Create design system with shared components
4. **Performance**: Page load < 2s, interactions < 100ms
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum

### Security & Privacy
1. **Data encryption**: At rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
2. **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication optional for users
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for shared projects
4. **PII handling**: GDPR compliant, minimal data collection
5. **Backup strategy**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention
